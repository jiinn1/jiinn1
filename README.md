## Hi there 👋

Polish beginner programmer on his way to get the first IT job

I decided to improve my skills only in the backend: Spring Boot 🍃

Before I started coding I spent a few months to learning about linux, networking and computer science

I've tested many distros, but my favorite for its simplicity and reliability it's just Linux Mint/Ubuntu (cinnamon 🫶)

I've never participated in bootcamps and have not studied any IT-related subject, I am self-taught
